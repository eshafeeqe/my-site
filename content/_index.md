<!-- This is the main content area. Write your bio here! -->

I'm **Your Name**, a writer and computer scientist. I grew up chasing grasshoppers in a small rice-farming village in Vietnam.

My focus is on ML/AI systems in production. I'm currently exploring creative use cases of AI in education and entertainment.

Previously, I worked at Amazing Company and Awesome Startup.

I graduated from University, where I taught a cool course. The lectures became the foundation for my book **My Awesome Book**, which is a #1 bestseller!

I enjoy learning about fun technical challenges and collaborating with great teams. [Reach out](/contact) if you want to find a way to work together!
