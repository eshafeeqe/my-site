## Featured Projects

### Quadrupedal Robots
At Antikythera Robotics, I developed and simulated Reinforcement Learning (RL) controllers for walking, self-righting, and balancing on a quadruped robot. This project involved architecting a real-time state estimation framework using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse data from 12 actuators, 2 IMUs, and a stereo camera.

*   **Tech Stack:** Python, C++, ROS, PyBullet, Drake, MuJoCo, PyTorch, Stable-Baselines3
*   **[See the project details »](/projects/quadruped-robotics-rl/)** 

### Real-time Monocular SLAM and Flicker-Free Segmentation Model
As a Research Programmer at Broadcast Virtual, I developed and deployed a monocular SLAM system that enables logo placement on a wide range of broadcast cameras without requiring additional sensors. This work involved porting keypoint detectors (SuperPoint, DISK) to TensorRT and implementing custom CUDA-based matchers to achieve real-time performance. I also prototyped a segmentation model for detecting on-screen graphics in broadcast videos and contributed to R&D efforts aimed at making LED replacement segmentation models flicker-free.

*   **Tech Stack:** C++, Python, PyTorch, TensorRT, CUDA, MLflow, Docker, Kubernetes
