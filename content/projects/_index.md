## Featured Projects

Here are some of the key projects I've worked on. Each project represents a deep dive into solving complex technical challenges.

### PhD Thesis: Non-rigid 3D Reconstruction of the Human Body in Motion
My PhD thesis at QUT and CSIRO Data61 introduced a novel method to decouple camera and object motion for high-accuracy 3D reconstruction. This work also included a skeleton-driven optimization framework to correct tracking failures for rapidly moving subjects.

*   **Tech Stack:** C++, CUDA, Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, PCL

### Reinforcement Learning for Quadruped Robotics
At Antikythera Robotics, I developed and simulated Reinforcement Learning (RL) controllers for walking, self-righting, and balancing on a quadruped robot. This project involved architecting a real-time state estimation framework using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse data from 12 actuators, 2 IMUs, and a stereo camera.

*   **Tech Stack:** Python, C++, ROS, PyBullet, Drake, MuJoCo, PyTorch, Stable-Baselines3

### Real-time Monocular SLAM System
As a Senior Research Programmer at Broadcast Virtual, I led the development and deployment of a monocular SLAM system to enable logo placement on a wide range of cameras without extra sensors. This involved porting keypoint detectors (SuperPoint, DISK) to TensorRT and implementing custom CUDA matchers for real-time performance.

*   **Tech Stack:** C++, Python, PyTorch, TensorRT, CUDA, MLflow, Docker, Kubernetes
